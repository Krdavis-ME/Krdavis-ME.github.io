      <h1>A little about me...</h1>
      <p>​Mechanical Engineer by education, developer by interest.</p>
          ​
          <p>Past six years, I have been studying and practicing engineering and it has left me wanting.
          In a moment of reflection, I asked myself, "what was the most enjoyable part of my studies?"
          What came to mind was an end of semester project. The task was to code an application that mapped the nodal equations of heat transfer over a simple geometry shape.  
          </p>
          <p>At the start, my programming skill was none, it did not stop me from persevering.  The end result may be sloppy, but it sparked interest in a different type of career path. 
          </p>
          <p>In this moment in time I have the opportunity to delve into the world of web development.  Learning the basics from HTML, CSS and Javascript to creating more dynamic applications with React. </p>
