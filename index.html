            <h3>​Mechanical Engineer by education, developer by interest.</h3>
            ​
            <p>Past six years, I have been studying and practicing engineering and it has left me wanting.
            In a moment of reflection, I asked myself, "what was the most enjoyable part of my studies?"
            What came to mind was an end of semester project. The task was to code an application that mapped the nodal equations of heat transfer over a simple geometry shape.  </p>
            <p>At the start, my programming skill was none, it did not stop me from persevering.  The end result may be sloppy, but it sparked interest in a different type of career path. </p>
            <p>In this moment in time I have the opportunity to delve into the world of web development.  Learning the basics from HTML, CSS and Javascript to creating more dynamic applications with React. </p>

        <h1>The Spark</h1>
        <p>The end of semester project,  started like many others before it, an individual project to test our knowledge. In an unforeseen event, it turned into a collaborative effort, students teaching each other, making sure the collective would all succeed.  It taught me patience when learning a new venture, to have determination to solve a problem at hand.  Even though the code is crude and inefficient, it was still effective. In a professional setting, it would be reiterated upon, possibly using switch statements in place of the many else ifs.</p>
